## Good to have

Please take some time to read [this](https://forum.denizenscript.com/threads/tiny-sample-scripts-to-start-with.354/) forum thread. It comes up with tiny useful scripts you can start with, but also contains an Auto-saver script that saves denizen files, which also dPrevention benefits from.
